## Stems what?

In music production, a _stem_ is a full-length mix of a single channel, track or instrument in your project.

A stems player allows you to listen to a song and mute each instrument individually while the song is playing. This is **not** intended to be a tool for music producers, but instead provides your audience with a fun experience to appreciate your song in an interactive way.

## What's in this demo?

This demo app includes the stems for the song "Kids" by MGMT, downloaded from [this source](https://remixpacks.ru/load/2/pop-1-0-9896/).

Play the song and tap on the instrument name to toggle muting.
